# double_pendulum
Simulation of the famous double pendulum system through the Runge Kutta method of order 4. The calculation is based on the simulation
from this website: https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html. The animation is made using the SDL library. 

# How to run

Step 1: Download all the files. \
Step 2: Via a terminal go to the double_pendulum directory. \
Step 3: Enter the "mingw32-make -f makefile" command. This should create a main.exe in the same folder. \
Step 4: Run main.exe. The terminal will output a text in regards to setting up the initial conditions of the double pendulum system.
