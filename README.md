# double_pendulum
A double pendulum is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end. This code simulates the temporal evolution of the
double pendulum by solving a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (using the Runge Kutta method) with given user specified
initial conditions. The rendering is done using the SDL2 library. 

# How to run

Step 1: Download all the files. \
Step 2: Open a terminal and go inside the `/double_pendulum` directory. \
Step 3: By running the `make all` command, it creates a `main` executable file in the same directory.  \
Step 4: Run the executable using the following command: `./main`. \
Step 5: Set up the initial conditions of the double pendulum or enter `d` to run the default values.
